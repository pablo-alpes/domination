            - Define the rule of cards and deck, are they going to be implemented?
            - Once the capture happens, and number of attacks, how to reinforce troops per player.
        5. Ask for a move: MoveExecutionService
        6. Execute the move checking whether is valid: Â©
        7. Define game continuation rules : a Game check service to do so ?
        7. Repeat the cycle until world is conquered by one player:
